	"about_title": "The goal of this Project",
	"about_intro": "The goal of this project is to document historical lifting stones from all over Norway. On this page, I will try to gather information about as many lifting stones as possible so that this information is publicly available.",
	"about_helleland_img": "Helleland-steinen besides Helleland Church outside Egersund",
	"about_1": "Lifting stones are a phenomenon that likely dates back to the dawn of time. Humans have always been fascinated by strength, and there has always been an interest in competing and determining who is the strongest. As a result, lifting stones have become a worldwide form of competition, and lifting stones are known from all over the world. In modern times, much of the historical stone lifting has been replaced by other strength sports, leading to the loss of information and history about these stones.",
	"about_2": "In Norway, there are many historical lifting stones, and probably even more waiting to be rediscovered. Norwegian stones come in a wide range of sizes, from the lightest at around 60 kg to the heaviest weighing several hundred kilograms. The oldest stone with a known history that I am aware of is <i>Viske-l√∏ftet</i> by Sevat Embrikson from 1750. If one wishes to find stones like this one, or uncover their stories, it will turn into quite a challenge. In fact, there is no comprehensive source of this information. Some sources exist where one can read about one or perhaps a handful of stones, but there is no reference work covering all of Norway.",
	"about_3": "This has been my inspiration for starting this project. Since its inception, my goal has been to compile information on all the known Norwegian lifting stones into a single reference . Without such a reference, I fear that an enormous amount of cultural history will be lost.",
	"about_4": "My own interest in historical lifting stones began with the stories of lifting stones from Iceland. Most people associate Iceland with volcanoes and glaciers, but for a small group of particularly interested individuals, myself included, Iceland is synonymous with strength culture and lifting stones.",
	"about_5": "Due to its climate, physical strength has always been important in Icelandic culture. Like Norway, Iceland has a great many historical lifting stones. However, unlike Norway, Iceland has preserved the stories of its lifting stones to a greater extent, making them easier to find.",
	"about_6": "After a trip to Iceland in 2023, where I visited several of the country's most famous lifting stones, I became very curious about whether similar stones existed in Norway. After countless hours of searching, the idea for this project was born.",
	"about_7": "As mentioned, written sources on lifting stones in Norway are very scarce, but there are likely countless people across Norway who know about lifting stones in their local area. That is why I need your help to complete this project! If you know of any lifting stones that are not mentioned on this site or have more information about any of them, I would love to hear from you. Perhaps you can help preserve Norway‚Äôs strength culture of lifting stones.",

	"fjotland_1": "Right next to the schoolhouse at the Fjotland Village Museum, there are two lifting stones: the smaller Reader‚Äôs Stone (Lesarsteinen) and the heavier Preacher‚Äôs Stone (Prestesteinen). Both stones provide a decent grip, but the Preacher‚Äôs Stone is naturally much more challenging to lift.",
	"fjotland_2": "Lifting the Reader‚Äôs Stone was traditionally considered a test of manhood, one that many young Fjotland residents attempted. The stone weighs 102 kg. Originally, it was located below Fjotland Church, right at the water‚Äôs edge of Fjotlandsvatnet.",
	"fjotland_3": "Weighing in at 207 kg, about twice the weight of the Reader‚Äôs Stone, the Preacher‚Äôs Stone is said to have been lifted by one of the village priests. It is uncertain exactly which priest gave the stone its name, but some point to Per Tobias Gunnuson Eiesland. Known as ‚ÄúPer Prest‚Äù (Per Priest) he he was a Fjotland native, born in Eiesland in 1840, and served as priest in Fjotland from 1886 to 1900.",
	"fjotland_4": "The stones are located just outside Kven√•sen Schoolhouse, along Fylkesvei-835. The school closed down in 1951 and was used as a community house until the building was moved to the museum in 1999.",

	"kolagarden_1": "At Kolagarden farm, there is a stone weighing <strong>128 kg (282 lbs)</strong>, known locally as a Manhood Stone. A man was expected to be able to lift this stone. The stone is somewhat elongated, making it relatively easy to get a good grip on. From the area where the stone is located, you have a great view over the entire valley.",
	"kolagarden_2": "To reach the stone, you have to walk a bit. From Gardavegen, follow the private road from the gate up to the farm. From there, the path is quite steep and rugged up to the stone. The stone is clearly visible on a small rock outcrop. It is approximately 1.5 km (0.9 miles) from Gardavegen to the stone.",
	"per_persasteinen_1": "Several legends exist about the great strength of Peder Pedersen from Fosen. Pedersen was a giant man who lived on the farm L√∏v√∏y in √Öfjord, and in addition to having great strength, he was also said to be a skilled blacksmith. He is said to have lifted the now <strong>247.5 kg</strong> heavy stone and carved the text which is written in the stone today:",
	"per_persasteinen_2": "Per Persasteinen was famous in Fosen, and fishing crews on their way to and from Lofoten often visited L√∏v√∏y. Here, the ‚Äúsk√•rungene‚Äù, meaning the first-time sailors, would try to lift the stone. One particularly strong young fisherman is said to have tried, but was unable to lift the stone, and in anger, struck off a piece weighing 10-12 kg with a sledgehammer. The break from the sledgehammer strike can still be seen on one of the short sides of the stone.",
	"per_persasteinen_3": "When Peder Pedersen lifted the stone, it weighed nearly 260 kg. It is also said that he added two extra weights on top of the stone, lifting a total weight of nearly 300 kg. What constitutes a good lift is unknown, but like several other Norwegian lifting stones, it is a reasonable assumption that the lift was considered valid if the stone clearly broke off the ground during the attempt.",
	"per_persasteinen_4": "The stone was moved to the museum at Sverresborg in 1935 for preservation and is now located on the museum grounds, right next to Haltdalen Stave Church. If you walk along the path around the museum, you will pass the stone near the coastal section. The stone is clearly visible from the path as you pass it.",

	"rysstad_1": "Outside Setesdal Museum at Rysstad lies a lifting stone that was historically used as a manhood test. The stone weighs 133.5 kg, has a flat underside and a rounded top. Originally, the stone was located near Brokke in Fardalen, to the west of Rysstad, one of Setesdal's side valleys.",
	"rysstad_2": "The stone was a manhood stone, used by younger boys in the area. If one of the boys managed to lift the stone, he was allowed to join the older men in drinking beer and spirits, certainly a strong motivation! The stone has been used as a manhood test in Fardalen as long as anyone can remember, but exactly how far back the tradition goes is unknown.",
	"rysstad_3": "The stone was moved from Fardalen to the museum in 1998 for preservation. It is now located in front of the museum building, right next to the flagpole on the lawn.",
	"sunnhordaland_museum_1": "Sunnhordlandstunet is a regional museum located in Vidsten park in Leirvik, on the island of Stord. The lifting stone, weighing <strong>106.5 kg</strong>, can be found inside the museum grounds, near the entrance to Eldhuset (An old kitchen). There is also a slightly smaller stone here, presumably as a warm-up for those who want to try lifting the main stone.",
	"sunnhordaland_museum_2": "A lift is considered valid if the stone is lifted straight up, such that it is clearly above the ground, without any aids. The stone is round and can be quite slippery, making it difficult for most people to get a good grip on it.",
	"sunnhordaland_museum_3": "The stone originally comes from Vatnadalen and is said to have been discovered in the Vatna River in 1913, by a work crew during the construction of a power plant. This year is also engraved on the top of the stone. At its original location, the stone was used as a test of strength until the 1960s when it was moved to the Vidsten park and the museum. Today, the stone is accessible to anyone who wants to try their hand at lifting it, and it continues to attract interest.",
	"sunnhordaland_museum_4": "Strength legend and Strongman Torkel Ravndal from Figgjo is one of those who has lifted the stone. When he performed one of his famous strength shows in Leirvik in the summer of 1991, he lifted the stone and remarked:",

	"tausaloftet_2": "To find Tausal√∏ftet, follow the tractor road from √Ösvegen towards Bogland. After passing Kleppsvatnet, you will see a large boulder on the left side of the road. Tausal√∏ftet is located just behind this boulder. The trip is about 1.5 hour one way.",
	"tausaloftet_1": "Along the road from √Öslia to Bogland lies Tausal√∏ftet (The Maid's Stone). The chalk-white stone, weighing <strong>73.5 kg</strong>, is located in Tronj√•, just above Kleppsvatnet lake. The stone is named after the servant girls, or tauser in Norwegian, who worked at the farm in Bogland, and used the stone as a test of strenght. It was common for them to attempt to lift the stone as they passed it on their way up to the farm. This tradition lasted at least until the 70s.",
	"trolten_name": "Trolten in √Ösland",
	"trolten_1": "Trolten is located on a farm in √Ösland in Kyrkjebygda. The stone is almost completely round, weighs <strong>93.5 kg</strong>, and has previously been used as a test of strength by young men in the village. A valid lift consists of lifting the stone from the ground in one movement, rolling it up your torso and throwing it over your shoulder such that it lands behind you. This is called throwing Trolten.",
	"trolten_2": "The stone has been on the farm for many generations, and it is said that it was the wife on the farm who brought it from the river. She liked the stone so much that she asked her husband to get the horse and drag the stone up from the river and to the farm. But the husband put off getting the stone, and when the wife eventually got tired of waiting, she took matters into her own hands. She rolled the stone up into her apron and carried it up to the farm, where it has been lying since.",
	"trolten_3": "There are several people from √Ösland who have lifted the stone, one of them is the uncle of the farmer who owns the farm today. When he was 14 years old in 1931, he threw Trolten. Thus he is the youngest person known to have lifted the stone.",
	"trolten_about": "On a farm in Kyrkjebygda there is a lifting stone called the Trolten. To perform a valid lift, Trolten must be thrown over the your shoulder.",
